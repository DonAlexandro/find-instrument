# Keep Copy
In this project I've tried to copy functional of **Google Keep**.
It has been written using MERN-stack and many others technologies and packages.
All in all, this project is not the worst of mine, although I've made one huge mistake, I haven't included Redux, 
so there are problems with state management and app doesn't look super dynamic,
but it's still fine

## Available Scripts

### `npm run start`
Builds the app once

### `npm run serve`
Starts the development server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### `npm run client`
Runs the client scripts

### `npm run dev`
Starts the server and the client at once using [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently)
